# Speaker recognition

Automatic speaker recognition project aims to recognize individual
people (verification task) in a data base from their voices. I worked
on the machine learning and also on the preprocessing voice separation
algorithms.

Developed machine learning (Bayesian classifier) and pre-processing
voice separation, and silence removal algorithms (Matlab) for
Automatic Speaker Recognition (verification task) project that aims to
recognize people by voice. The project was sold to Start-up

# Crop Recogntion and Crop date determination

Crop Recognition and Automatic Determination of the Planting Date
project which analyzes satellite images in order to determine planting
dates and the crops planted in producing regions.

# Wrinkle Analysis

I developed an image processing algorithm to extract facial
wrinkles. A score was attributed to the wrinkles and these data were
correlated with medical data in order to determine skin age.

It was a marketing project that was being developed for a cosmetic
company to recommend products to their clients based on their skin
age.

# Magnetic noise attenuation system

Magnetic noise attenuation system: In this project, I designed a
compensation coil in order to reduce magnetic noise in magnetic
resonance scanner room. Also, I worked on the implementation of the
attenuation algorithm.

# Virtual Eye

The increase in performance of the modern computers has driven
scientific work in the areas of computer simulation. Many authors use
in their research commercial tools that use embedding algorithms,
which sources are not provided, and it makes harder and sometimes
impossible, the development of novel theories or experiments. This
work explores this gap left for those authors. We present a
computational framework capable to reproduce the optical and
physiological phenomena of the human visual system. We construct
schematical models of the human eye from quadrics surfaces and
consider an algorithm of realistic ray tracing. Afterward, we
performed a study on schematics models and in addition we introduce,
in these models, in-vivo data obtained from corneal topography machine
and extract optical information. We calculate the Zernike coefficients
in the models for different sizes of pupil and measures of aberration
of the human eye. The results are in agreement with related work and
simulations with in-vivo data are according with the produced by a
commercial wave-front device. This work is an effort in using to
advantage the information acquired for the modern equipment of
ophthalmology, besides assisting the understanding of biological
visual systems, it also helps the development of artificial vision
systems and the designing of optical systems
